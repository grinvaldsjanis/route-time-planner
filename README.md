# GPX Time Planner

https://route-time-planner.vercel.app/

Hello! Welcome to my pet project, designed to optimize time scheduling for pre-drawn GPX tracks. I'm passionate about day-long cross-country journeys that involve visiting multiple points of interest (POIs). Previously, I found it challenging to efficiently manage arrival, stay, and departure times at various stop-points to ensure the route is completed within a predicted timeframe. This tool is invaluable for organizing events and group travels.

The app supports various activities, including motorcycle riding, walking, running, bicycling, and driving. One of its standout features is the colorized track line, which represents elevation, curvature, and slope—three critical factors that influence the time calculation. From my experience, the calculated times closely match those from routes I have previously traversed.

Please note that the app does not account for road conditions or surface types, which may impact accuracy in challenging segments of the route.

In the future, I plan to introduce an editable "hardness" property for track sections, allowing users to adjust the time calculation based on the terrain's difficulty.
